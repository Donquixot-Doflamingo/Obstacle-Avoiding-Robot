* ## Solution Approach
- Obstacle Avoiding is a car that is fitted with Ultrasonic sensor. It works on ultrasonic principle with Arduino board playing a vital role.
- When we will switched on the car. It will move in forward direction.
- Ultrasonic will transmit ultrasonic waves and will check if there is an obstacle in the path.
- If there comes an obstacle, then the car will stop and servo motor will rotate 90Â° right, ultrasonic sensor attached to the motor will also rotate and sends the ultrasonic waves.
- If there is no obstacle in right direction, then car turns right.
- If there is an obstacle in right also, then car will check the obstacle in left direction
similarly.
- If there is no obstacle in left direction, then car turns left. Otherwise it will stop.
